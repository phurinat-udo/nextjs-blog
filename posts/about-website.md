This website is designed to be personal blog and portfolio of the owner.
The website is developed using **Next.js** framework and deployed on **Vercel** to be the final project of Application Developments Course in Innovative Physics Program, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University.

<!-- Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others. -->
